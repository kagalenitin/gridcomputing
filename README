This would be my first take on Grid Computing. 
The problem domain in not yet defined and there would be flavor of both, data as well as computational grids.
Hoping to tacke financial domain. However, that is not finalized yet.

Plan includes:
* Mechanism to aggregate data from different sources, aggregate them and store them as a model.
* Expose Apis to run queries against the data to get summarized and functional results over the data.
* Computation of queries against the rules defined.
